# Savitsky's-method-for-planing-hulls
The project was carried out in Python, using only elementary libraries. The code asks for necessary user input regarding the geometric and hydrodynamic properties of the hull. 
It then calculates, step by step, every aspect of Savitsky's method, and returns all the numerical results. Of utmost interest are the values for drag force and propulsion power demand.
The mathematical framework of the project is based on related engineering courses the author attended during his MSc degree.
